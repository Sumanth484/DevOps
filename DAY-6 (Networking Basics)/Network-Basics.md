## Networking Fundamentals and DevOps Concepts

### `IP Essentials` üìã

- **`IP Addresses: IPv4 and IPv6`**
  - **`IPv4`**: 
    - **`Concept`**: IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical identifiers assigned to devices connected to a network, structured in a 4-octet format (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
    - **`Purpose`**: Identifies and locates devices on a network, essential for communication.
    - **`Limitations`**: Limited address space (4.3 billion addresses) leading to IPv4 address exhaustion.
  
  - **`IPv6`**: 
    - **`Concept`**: IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers, designed to solve IPv4 address exhaustion, expressed in hexadecimal notation (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
    - **`Purpose`**: Provides a larger address space to accommodate future growth of the Internet and more efficiently route traffic.
    - **`Advantages`**: Enhanced security features, improved multicast and anycast abilities, simplified network management.

### `Routing & Subnetting` üó∫Ô∏è

- **`CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing`**
  - **`Concept`**: CIDR is a method used to allocate IP addresses and route IP packets efficiently.
  - **`Benefits`**: Allows flexible allocation of IP addresses by dividing the IP address space into smaller blocks (`subnets`).
  - **`Subnetting`**: Subnetting involves dividing a single network into smaller networks (`subnets`), enabling efficient use of IP addresses and improved network performance.

- **`Subnets: Public vs Private, with Subnet Masks`**
  - **`Public Subnets`**: Typically used for resources that need direct access to the internet. They have a route to an `Internet Gateway`.
  - **`Private Subnets`**: Used for resources that should not have direct internet access. They rely on `Network Address Translation (NAT)` to access the internet indirectly.
  - **`Subnet Mask`**: Determines the range of IP addresses within a subnet, specifying which part of an IP address represents the network and which part represents the host.

### `Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Securing Networks` üîí

- **`Network ACLs: Network Access Control Lists`**
  - **`Purpose`**: Acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of a subnet.
  - **`Key Functions`**: 
    - Defines both `inbound` and `outbound rules` to allow or deny specific types of traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
    - Operates at the subnet level and is `stateless` (each rule applies to both directions independently).

- **`Security Groups: Filtering Inbound and Outbound Traffic`**
  - **`Concept`**: Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.
  - **`Features`**:
    - Managed at the instance level (`stateful`), automatically allowing return traffic initiated from allowed `inbound traffic`.
    - Rules are defined based on protocols, ports, and source/destination IP addresses.

### `Gateway & Routing Tables` üö™

- **`Internet Gateways and NAT Gateways`**
  - **`Internet Gateway`**: Provides a target in your `VPC route tables` for internet-bound traffic.
  - **`NAT Gateway`**: Enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, without exposing their private IP addresses.

- **`Route Tables and Routes`**
  - **`Route Tables`**: Define rules (`routes`) for traffic leaving the subnet.
  - **`Routing`**: Routes determine where network traffic is directed, such as to a specific `gateway` or another instance within the same network.

### `OSI & TCP/IP Models` üìà

- **`OSI Model & TCP/IP Model`**: 
  - **`OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model`**: 
    - Defines a conceptual framework used to understand network communication between devices in a networked environment.
    - Consists of 7 layers: `Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application`.
  
  - **`TCP/IP Model`**: 
    - A simplified model used for network communication and internet protocol suite.
    - Combines the OSI model's `physical` and `data link layers` into a single `"Network Interface"` layer, resulting in 4 layers: `Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application`.
